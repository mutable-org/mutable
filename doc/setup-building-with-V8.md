# Building mu*t*able with V8

## Dependencies

Install the following dependencies:

* [Google `depot_tools`](setup-depot_tools.md)
* [Google `gn`](setup-gn.md)

## Configuration

#### Disable `depot_tools` Self-Updates

Prevent `depot_tools` from self-updating by setting `DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE=0` in your environment.  This depends on your
local setup.  E.g.

**`/etc/profile`**
```bash
export DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE=0
```

You can verify this with
```bash
$ env | grep DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE
DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE=0
```

#### Properly configure your `$PATH`

Configure your `$PATH` to contain standalone `gn` and the `deopt_tools`.  In particular, you should not put
`depot_tools` *at the beginning* of your `$PATH`, i.e.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/depot_tools" # GOOD
# export PATH="/opt/depot_tools:$PATH" BAD
```

You can verify that standalone `gn` is used with
```bash
$ whereis gn
gn: /usr/bin/gn /opt/depot_tools/gn # lists standalone gn first!
```
